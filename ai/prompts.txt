I want to build a satirical website on nobels.no that has a marketplace for buying and selling nobels prices in light of current events. I already use the Next-stack so that might be a good idea, but I'm open to Svelte too (if you guide me so I can learn!)

I also like to have a "LinkedIn Jerk-Circle Post Generator". Discount codes should also be available when buying (poke fun of war crimes++). I also want
a "nominate yourself" function where you can where you can hit a "nag/cry/act like a man child" button until you win. I want clear references to Donald
Trump and María Corina Machado. I also want the disclaimers and warnings to nod to the original Jackass Series warnings (as everyone seems to be
jackasses right now). Focus on how the governments (mainly Norway) are sellouts and promote war just and just pretend to care about peace (selling
weapons etc). I also want a merch shop for the poor (something with laks, and all i got was this lousy t-shirt, sticker, etc - be creative here!)

Enchance the UI and use proper fonts (and sizes). Enhance the nominate yourself. I want an interactive game where you keep nagging until thye say "Fine
we'll consider you!". Use Trump rhetoric.
