I want to build a satirical website on nobels.no that has a marketplace for buying and selling nobels prices in light of current events. I already use the Next-stack so that might be a good idea, but I'm open to Svelte too (if you guide me so I can learn!)

I also like to have a "LinkedIn Jerk-Circle Post Generator". Discount codes should also be available when buying (poke fun of war crimes++). I also want
a "nominate yourself" function where you can where you can hit a "nag/cry/act like a man child" button until you win. I want clear references to Donald
Trump and María Corina Machado. I also want the disclaimers and warnings to nod to the original Jackass Series warnings (as everyone seems to be
jackasses right now). Focus on how the governments (mainly Norway) are sellouts and promote war just and just pretend to care about peace (selling
weapons etc). I also want a merch shop for the poor (something with laks, and all i got was this lousy t-shirt, sticker, etc - be creative here!)

Enchance the UI and use proper fonts (and sizes). Enhance the nominate yourself. I want an interactive game where you keep nagging until thye say "Fine
we'll consider you!". Use Trump rhetoric.

We should be careful gloryfying María (especially after giving the price to Trump), so tone down that part. As for the game - the tweets are funny but
disappears to quickly. Should act more like a traditional toast where hovering keeps them visible. Maybe even have a way to view them later in a message
box. And feel free to throw in more Trump-ism to make it more absurd whilst. Also the random message/tweet tends to show the same over and over. Try to
show as many of them as we can and re-cycle only when needed!

If we can somehow mix in special Epstein stuff, that be golden (Jagland is in the
  files). Be careful with direct defamation in this regard. And my man Jonas G needs to
  be in here (recent news). And some Greenland stuff too. If you can - generate photos
  too (especially in the merch store). And lets slap on a certifed 100% AI
  Generated/Prompted somewhere. Finally - when buying something I want you to instead
  encourage user to consider donating to a organization worthwile fighting instead of
  supporting these clowns. Maybe make a list and send the user to their pages if they
  click.
