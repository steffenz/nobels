> The World's Premier Nobel Prize Marketplace - A Satirical Website

**100% AI Generated** - This entire project was built through prompt engineering with Claude (Anthropic's AI). A human provided the vision, and AI wrote all the code.

## What is this?

NobelMarket is a satirical website that imagines a marketplace for buying and selling Nobel Prizes. It's a commentary on:

- The irony of Norway giving peace prizes while being a major weapons exporter
- The questionable history of Nobel Prize decisions (Kissinger, anyone?)
- Political figures who feel entitled to recognition
- Institutional hypocrisy in general

**This is satire.** No actual Nobel Prizes are for sale. Please don't sue us.

## Features

- **Marketplace** - Browse satirical Nobel Prize listings with absurd descriptions
- **Nominate Yourself** - An interactive game where you nag the committee Trump-style until they give in
- **LinkedIn BS Generator** - Generate the kind of humble-brag posts you see on LinkedIn
- **Merch Shop** - Ironic merchandise for "the poor" (with salmon, obviously)
- **War Crimes Discount Codes** - Because dark humor is still humor
- **Donation Redirects** - All "buy" buttons redirect to real charities instead

## Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit** - Framework
- **TypeScript** - Language
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Styling
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - AI that wrote all the code

## How It Was Made

This project was created entirely through conversations with Claude. The human role was:

1. Describe features and vision
2. Provide feedback
3. Iterate with refinements
4. Make creative decisions

The AI handled all technical implementation.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome! **Pro tip: Submit issues as prompts.**

Instead of "The button doesn't work", try:
> "Make the button on the merch page actually do something fun when clicked"

We're more likely to implement features described as prompts because that's literally how this whole thing was built.

## Disclaimer

This is satire. Any resemblance to actual war criminals, politicians, or Norwegian arms dealers is entirely intentional. We are not affiliated with the Nobel Foundation, the Norwegian government, or anyone who takes themselves too seriously.

MIT - Do whatever you want with this code. We certainly did.

Made with a human who had opinions about peace prizes and an AI that was very patient.
